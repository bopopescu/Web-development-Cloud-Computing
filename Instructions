2. A home page that lets authenticated users browse thumbnails(created by ImageMagick) of their photos.
3. An option for uploading a new photo. 
4. Whenever a new image is uploaded, the application should automatically create 3 different transformations(eg.scale down, enlarge, black and white,sepia)(Implemented by ImageMagick).
5. Clicking on a photo's thumbnail should produce the full resolution version of the photo as well as it's transformations.


Requirements:
1. All images should be stored in the local file system(virtual hard drive of the EC2 instance).
2. Store information about user accounts, their locations of images in a relational database.
[Do not store images themselves in the database; The database should follow design practice and schema is properly normalized.]
3. Store the hash of users' password concatenated with a per-user salt value.
4. Include a URI that makes it possible for the TA to automatically upload photos to populate their account. URI conform to some interface.
5. Application deployed on a single AWS EC2 instance of type t2.small
